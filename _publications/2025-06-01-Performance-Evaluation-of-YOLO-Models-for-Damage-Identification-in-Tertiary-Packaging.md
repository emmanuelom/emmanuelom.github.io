## Abstract

This research compares the performance of the latest state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, specifically YOLOv5n, YOLOv6n, YOLOv7-Tiny, and YOLOv8n. For this purpose, images of cardboard packaging with various damaged and undamaged samples were utilized. The classification and identification process considered five categories: undamaged, face damage, edge damage, corner damage, and top damage. Experimental results were obtained for each of the four models, reporting average precision, average recall, F1-score, and mAP@50, which assess the accuracy level in categorizing damage to the packaging. This study aims to provide a solution using computer vision capable of performing more effective classifications to support individuals conducting visual inspection processes based on attributes and mitigate workplace blindness. Thus, it reduces costs in reverse logistics and indirectly benefits the reduction of environmental pollution caused by various transport methods used in reverse logistics.
